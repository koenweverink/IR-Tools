# IR-Tools
Scripts and documentation for my final thesis

# How to use the tool.

1.  Install all the requirements that are listed in requirements.txt.
2.  In each main .py file (powershell.py, wmi.py, psexec.py and cred_dump.py), place the path to the required location, such as the event logs and registries.
3.  Run gui.py and it should run!

In future versions, step 2 will be integrated into the GUI itself.


# Velociraptor

In the velociraptor folder, the main.py file handles everything to do with Velociraptor, however this only works with your own version of Velociraptor and 
the config files generated by yourself. So the ones that are there are just examples and need to be replaced. For a more in-depth guide on how to do that, please refer
to my thesis.


# DeepBlueCLI

If you want to use the DeepBlueCLI triage tool, download the .ps1 script from https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI. Then point the path to the location of that script.


# In-Depth Documentation per script

In the docs folder are html files generated by pdoc from docstrings in the scripts themselves. These offer a more in-depth documentation for each script, since they
describe each class, funtion and their parameters.
